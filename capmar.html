<div>
  It's the 1990s, and Carol Danvers is caught between two alien races in a
  galactic war. As the action heats up, much of what Carol believes is put into
  question: her identity, who she can trust, and the true strength of her
  powers. One of Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful heroes makes her
  debut in this origin story based on the life of Captain Marvel.
