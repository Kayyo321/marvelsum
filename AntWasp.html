<h1>Ant=Man And The Wasp</h1>
<div>
  Two years after Scott Lang was placed on house arrest due to his involvement
  with the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords,[N 1] Hank Pym and his
  daughter Hope van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm.
  They believe Pym's wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking
  to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum
  realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantum entangled with Janet, and now he
  receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest,
  Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due
  to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy
  so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message
  from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a
  stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve
  her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer
  Sonny Burch, who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from
  Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights
  off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantum unstable masked
  woman. Lang tries to help fight off this "ghost", but the woman escapes with
  Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase..
